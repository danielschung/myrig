                Faders and LED buttons 1-8 (Bank A) control channels 1-8 in Ableton. Clicking the CONTROL BANK button on the Akai MPK-49 switches to Bank B, which I have mapped Faders and LED buttons 1-4 (Bank B) to control channels 10-13. Fader and LED button 8 (Bank B) controls channel 15, which is the pre-recorded channel for launched clips. Bank C controls nothing as of now.

                <h1>INSTRUMENTS</h1>
                
                <h2>OVERVIEW OF SPECIFIC CHANNELS</h2>
                
                <p>I have found that in engineering sounds, stacking multiple channels together is the best way to get a dynamic and full sounding instrument. Maybe it’s because I’m inexperienced and inefficient with my engineering, but that’s how I’ve been doing it for now. Here is a list of certain instruments I’ve created by stacking channels. </p>
                
                <h2>AMBIENT SYNTHS (1-6 BANK A)</h2>
                
                <p>The first three channels comprise the ambient, background synths that can be altered by moving each volume Fader on the MIDI Keyboard. These 3 channels supplement each another to provide a dynamic range of textures in one instrument, ranging from low-bounding ambient synths used in slower songs to high pitched harsher synths for faster songs.
                <br><br>
                Channel 1 is a harsher sounding, gritty ambient sound.
                <br><br>
                Channel 2 is a normal sine wave analog sounding synth.
                <br><br>    
                Channel 3 is a high pitched, airy sounding synth.
                <br><br>
                Used all together and depending on the level of any of the channels, you can get some interesting sounds ranging anywhere from chiller worship synths to higher-angelic melodies.
                <br><br>
                Channel 4 is a more lead based synth which I sometimes use to slip into certain songs. I often use this along with the ambient sounds to add a bit of melody in the synth in key moments.
                <br><br>
                Channel 5 is a delayed glass instrument that I use in slower songs, usually along with the ambient synth.
                <br><br>
                Channel 6 is a piano instrument that I downloaded for free from Ableton Live’s page. Since we have a separate piano player at CFC, I’ve never used it. But I thought it would be good to have just in case.
                </p>
                
                <p id="note">Using the MOD wheel (which is mapped to alter the filter frequency effect on the Master Track) in tandem with the ambient sound gives you more control over the synth. When turned all the way down, it gives the synth a duller, distant sound. When turned all the way up, it gives the synth a fuller and closer sound.</p>
                
                <h2>LAUNCHING PRE-RECORDED CLIPS (PAD BANKS A-D)</h2>
                
                <p>Channel 7 is the sound used only in the intro when CFC plays “Take It All” by Hillsong. There is a pre-recorded clip that I usually launch at 157 BPM.
                <br><br>
                One of the primary challenges I've faced in using pre-recorded materials in a live band setting is keeping up with a live drummer because in the tempo of a live band is constantly changing. The built-in tap tempo function in Ableton is not helpful in this regard because it immediately resets any clip that is playing at the moment, giving the clip a very un-smooth transition. After a few months I finally discovered a Max for Live program at the bottom of an insignificant forum on like the 27th page in my Google Search that some random guy named Christopher Dobrian built to make the tap tempo transition smoother and more intuitive.
                </p>
                
                <a href="https://cycling74.com/forums/how-to-create-a-tap-tempo-in-max/#.WJzFsxIrJE6" target="_blank"><div class="equipment-pic" id="tap-tempo"></div></a>
                
                <p>This Tap Tempo Transition program acts like an effect that you can put onto an instrument, but it affects the whole set. I placed this program onto Channel 15 which is the channel that I keep some pre-recorded clips.</p>
                
                <p id="note">Note: In order for this program to be assignable to MIDI CCs, you have to do a little tweaking. Click on the edit button in the top right corner. It should bring up the editor
                <br><br>
                Add a Max for Live Button by clicking the Max for Live Objects drop menu, then dragging the live.button (the solid colored circle) onto the editor. Next, click on the Patching Mode button on the bottom of the editor. You’ll see all the components of the program with wire looking things connecting them. Drag the bottom of your live.button to the top of the regular button to establish a connection. Save your changes and close the editor. Now you should see your changes appear in the program. You can now MIDI map the live.button to a MIDI controller to set the tempo smoothly. I map this button to the B button on the Foot Controller so I can tap in a tempo with my foot.
                </p>
                
                <p>I usually don’t use pre-recorded samples for extended periods because even with the smoother Tap Tempo feature it’s difficult to stay 100% in sync with a drummer. It’s important to remember to be careful with pre-recorded clips because the congregation’s connection to God is the priority. If done correctly it can be auditory supplement at best, but if done wrong it can quickly become a resounding gong. In result, I don’t do it often.</p>
                
                <h2>EDM SYNTHS (1-4 BANK B)</h2>
                
                <p>Channels 9-13 are used for Hillsong Young and Free type songs. Since these are usually used separately from the rest of the instruments, I MIDI mapped them to bank B on the Akai MPK-49. The reason they are set up this way is because these types of sounds require quick switching between verse, chorus, bridge, etc., and activating each synth with the first three LCD buttons in Bank B is helpful.
                <br><br>
                Starting from Channel 10, this is the general Trancey-Lead synth sound.
                <br><br>
                Channel 11 consists of three is some lead stab sounds I’ve stacked together into one channel. Clicking on the arrow next to the name on the top of the channel reveals three hidden channels containing a synth I call Panda Keys, a mid-ranged backup sound, and a high-ranged definition sound.
                <br><br>
                Channel 12 is two instruments in one. Expanding the hidden channels reveals two synths. The first is a glide synth, the second is a quiet stab synth. For this channel I usually keep only one of these turned on at once depending on the song. That way, pressing the third LCD button will activate only sound instead of both.
                <br><br>
                Channel 13 consists of three sounds that comprise a Tropical House Lead instrument. The first is a light pluck, the second is a Panflute, the third is my recreation of Kygo’s lead sound. I usually keep all three armed so that touching the fourth LCD button in Bank B activates all of them.
                <br><br>
                Going back to channel 9, this is the boost lead sound I’ve created to give the overall EDM sound a boost during choruses. The track activator is mapped to button A on the Foot Controller for hands-free activation. 
                </p>
                
                <h2>SWEEPS AND RUSH</h2>
                
                <p>Channels 22-24. These are pre-recorded sounds that are set to a Gate Launch mode, meaning it only lasts as long as the button is held down. These are good for buildups in Young and Free songs.
                <br><br>    
                Channel 22 contains the Sweep buildup clip.
                <br><br>
                Channel 23 contains the Rush buildup clip, which was created to emulate the rush of wind type sound that occurs after a buildup.
                <br><br>
                The Rush clip (channel 23) is programmed to get louder or “rush” after releasing the button, so when both  the Sweep sound and Rush sounds are activated, you get a sound that builds up when pressing the button, and Rushes when released.
                <br><br>    
                I set button C on the Foot Controller to launch the Sweep Clip (channel 22) and Rush Clip (channel 23) together. Button D on the Food Controller launches the Choppy Swoop (channel 24), which is an LFO’ed version of Sweep (more choppy according to tempo).</p>
